    description: 'Use as a feature toggle. Completely turn on or off a broker as both source and sink for all topics.\r\nThis can be used when a new broker is being installed. Or when we migrate from one broker to another. It can also be used to turn off any interaction with the broker while the broker is temporarily unavailable. After re-enabling the broker, the producers and consumers will continue where they left off before the broker was turned off.\r\nConsider that it might take a moment until the change takes effect. The producers and consumers will check this state every few minutes in case there is no real-time signal implement to request a stop.\r\nGenerally the producers and consumers will first finish the work they started before stopping.'

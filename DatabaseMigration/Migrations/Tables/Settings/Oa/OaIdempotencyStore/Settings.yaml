  name: 'OaIdempotencyStore'
  description: 'A table to support idempotent POST OpenAPI calls.\r\nThis table lives temporarily in finstar main db and will later be moved to a dedicated private place. It is used to store responses of successfully processed calls, so that subsequent calls with the same idempotency key can get the same response without changing the state of the system.\r\nThe idempotency key is set at the beginning of each call where as well the LockAcquiredDateTime is set. As soon as the call completes without errors, the Response is set by the application and as well the LockAcquiredDateTime is set to null, indicating that the call has finished. In case of an error, only the LockAcquiredDateTime is set. This allows to automatically retry failed requests using the same idempotency key while at the same time protecting from a double execution of successful calls.'

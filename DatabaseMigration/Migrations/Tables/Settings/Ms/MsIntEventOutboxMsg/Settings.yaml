  - name: 'IsRealTime'
    description: 'Whether the first event in the cascade was triggered real-time as part of an active  business process. False means, the event is a replay-event or another type of artificially generated event, For example by polling entities and observing whether their state changed, and if so, inferring events that might have happened since the  last poll. Such events have no guarantee to arrive in the order in which they occurred in the source system. This should only be set to false when interacting with legacy parts of the system that don''t naturally provide events.'

It indicates that the event history for this entity can be moved to an archive and removed from all transactional systems.\r\nOnce a tomb stone event is published to the broker, all the past events referring to the same key will be deleted at some (maybe undefined yet) point in the future.\r\nWhen this happens, only the tomb stone event should be left in order to indicate that "there was something".\r\nThe archived events could be encrypted with a public key while the private key for decryption remains in a secure place that nobody can access except under highly regulated circumstances.'

  - name: 'MessageKey'
    description: 'The key of the message that is used for partitioning and routing by the event broker.\r\nOften it is the id of the entity or and aggregate which the event is about, so that all the events of a particular entity end up in the same partition and temporarily ordered,  providing sequential consistency within the partition. Keys can also contain more context information and be structured like URIs.\r\nIf such an id  is taken, the key will usually be only a few bytes. They should be small enough so that routing and load balancing can be done efficiently.\r\nThe assignment to a partition is relevant for load balancing in a microservice architecture with a cluster of microservice nodes that distribute the workload. By routing messages with the same key to the same node every time it is possible that the same microservice sees all the events related to the same key.\r\nFor example, a good option for the key could be the PartnerId such that all events having something to do with a particula partner end up in the same partition.'
